# Trivia Game Api

##Getting started 
Open the page <a href="https://jojokcreator.github.io/simple-trivia-api-game/">Here<a/> or clone/download and open the index.html in a web browser.

## Week 2 School Of Code Project.
A simple quiz built in JavaScript that pulls quiz questions from an API site [Open Trivia](https://opentdb.com/)

We used event listeners to change innerText on the Dom to make the quiz work in the browser 

Still need to tidy up the CSS layout of the game but it does function. There are problems with the encoding of some of the questions which results in some characters not being displayed correctly. At the moment 10 random questions are pulled in on load.
